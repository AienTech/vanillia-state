# Vanilla State

A Lightweight Vanilla Javscript State System

  - Pure Vanilla ES6+
  - Handles state in a simple eloquent way at an object level

A lot of projects over complicate state management. At the end of the day state management is really just the versioning and maintance of an object. The beauty of Javascript is the fact that all objects are inherently pass by reference. Therefore these objects can be passed to multiple areas of your applciation and their state can be handled via one easy to use state management service. Vanilla State is a class based system that can be implemeneted into any Vanilla, Angular, React, Vue etc service to handle the state of an object and be used as the entire state management system. The concept of Vanilla State doe s not follow the normal pardigm of state managemnt, but rather simplifies it and makes it more practical.
